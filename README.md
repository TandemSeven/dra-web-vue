# dra-web-vue

This dra demonstrates the Vue Javascript Framework, in addition to Vuex for state management, and Vue Router for routing.

The app displays current and forecasted weather for your current location, allowing you to search weather for another location by zip code.

Data is powered by a few free/open APIs (IP API to convert IP to Lat/Long Coordinates, Zippopotamus to convert Coordinates to Zip Code, and Weather.gov for all weather-related data).
